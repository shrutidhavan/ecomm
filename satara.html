It is also believed that the Pandavas stayed in Wai, then known as 'Viratnagari', in the 13th year of exile.
The Sahyadri range, or main range of the Western Ghats, runs north and south along the western edge of the district, separating it from Ratnagiri district. The Mahadeo range starts about 10 m. north of Mahabaleshwar and stretches east and south-east across the whole of the district. The Mahadeo hills are bold, presenting bare scarps of black rock like fortresses. The Satara district is part of two main watersheds. The Bhima River watershed, which is a tributary of the Krishna, includes the north and northeast of the district, north of the Mahadeo hills. The rest of the district is drained by the upper Krishna and its tributaries. The hill forests have a large store of timber and firewood. The whole of Satara district falls within the Deccan Traps area; the hills consist of trap intersected by strata of basalt and topped with laterite, while, of the different soils on the plains, the commonest is the black loamy clay containing carbonate of lime. This soil, when well watered, is capable of yielding heavy crops. Satara contains some important irrigation works, including the Krishna canal. In some of the western parts of the district the average annual rainfall exceeds 5 m.; but on the eastern side water is scanty, the rainfall varying from 1 m in Satara town to less than 30 cm in some places farther east. The district is traversed from north to south by a railway line, which passes 15 km east Satara town.
Satara District can be proud of the oldest Rashtrakuta history.

Satara is a town located in the Satara District of Maharashtra. The town gets its name from the Seven (Sat) Hills(Taras) surrounding it.
The Vyasa-puja of the year was performed at Satara on 27th of July, 1980.
 During His long camp at Satara,  His Holiness Pujyasri Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji desired that a temple for Sri Nataraja on the model of the ancient Nataraja temple at Chidambaram should be constructed at Satara.
 The foundation for the temple was laid on an auspicious day in May 1981. Because of the grace of the Mahaswami, by the financial assistance of the then governments of the States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and the supply of the entire timber necessary for the construction by the government of Kerala and diverse kinds of aid by a number of philanthropists, a majestic temple of Sri Nataraja with gopurams (towers) over the four gateways, a replica of the original in Tamil Nadu, though much smaller in size, rose up in Satara in the course of about three years.
